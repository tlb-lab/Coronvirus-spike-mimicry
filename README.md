Three-dimensional models of the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) receptor-binding motifs (RBM) aligned with potential mimics are displayed as PyMol sessions in the "figure_models" directory

Raw data collected from each of the structural alignment tools for each RBM are found in the "raw_data" directory.

Inquiries on models and data can be sent to cab233@cam.ac.uk and tlb20@cam.ac.uk
